This is a placeholder file for the database backup.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary .bak file that contains a complete backup of the Online Exam System database.

The actual file would be several megabytes in size and would contain:
- Database schema (tables, views, stored procedures)
- All data stored in the database
- Database configuration settings

For demonstration purposes, this placeholder indicates where the real .bak file would be placed.
Users would download this file and restore it in SQL Server Management Studio to create a complete copy of the database.
